```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Libraries
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

## Set up my filtering up top so I can quickly change the subsets with minimal typing
```{r}
speciesopt <- c("virginica | versicolor") #Here I want to be able to choose one or more species, possibly using and/or
petalwopt <- c("<=0.2") #Here I want to be able to select a subset of petal.widths based on value. Probably don't want to use chr's here, but I'm just shorthanding it for now.
```

## Filter some Stuff
```{r}
iris_sum <- iris %>% 
  where(Species %in% grepl(speciesopt) & Petal.Width %in% grepl(petalwopt))
# not sure 'where' is right, or if I have the right orders with %in% and grepl, but hopefully this gives the idea
```

## Plot
```{r}
ggplot(iris_sum) #etc etc etc the rest of my ggplot stuff.
```

You can also insert citations (and create a bibliography) from visual [@willette2013]

Or tables

| Col1   | Col2   | Col3 |
|--------|--------|------|
| Item 1 |        |      |
| Item 2 |        |      |
|        | Item 3 |      |

```{r}
x <- 4*3
# This is a comment inside code
# Use RMarkdown to insert text inside of code inside of text inside of code insi-
```
